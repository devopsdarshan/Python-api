# Pre-requisites:

Make sure that you run ```aws configure``` on the server/machine you will be running it because the code will be using those credentials while executing the code.

# Steps:

1) Download the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/devopsdarshan/Python-REST-API-for-AWS.git ```

2) Change to that directory:
```cd Python-REST-API-for-AWS```

3) Install all the required python packages:
```pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt```

4) Run the main python file:
```python app.py```

You should get similar output:

```
